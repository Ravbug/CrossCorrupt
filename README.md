# CrossCorrupt
Cross platform file / folder corrupting tool, written in C# and Eto.forms.

## About
This is a general purpose file corruption program. It's inspired by the [Vinesauce ROM corruptor](https://github.com/Rikerz/VRC) but designed to be cross platform.
THe Vinesauce Corruptor is for Windows only. The program corrupts files on the byte level, so any file, binary or not, should work.

## Features
- Byte corrupt any file (insert, replace, delete byte)
- Corrupt entire folders (choose which file types to corrupt / not to corrupt)
- Folder scramble: randomize the names of the items in a folder (for messing up textures / sounds)
- Auto randomize settings, with configuration

See the Wiki for a more detailed feature list.
